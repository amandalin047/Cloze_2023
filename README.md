## Code snippet for sorting cloze results
- `sample.xlsx` is a small excerpt from our actual cloze rating results (I've modified three unexpected endings for demonstration purposes).
- Here are several of the things that need your help:
  * Check if any of the unexpected endings share characters with their best completion counterparts.
  * Generate a unique list of all the best completions provided by our offline participants (i.e., no word can occur more than once in this list) and export this list to a Google form for valence and arousal ratings.
  * Per our valence rating results, obtain the sentential valence constraint for each sentence frame.
- I wrote the code in haste, so it's not guranteed to be bug-free... Feel free to create an issue on this repo (or just message me on Slack/Discord); all questions are welcome.
- For concerns about intellectual property (our rating results shouldn't be put out into the open like this), I'll switch the visibility to private by next week; let me know if you'd like to be added as a collaborator on this repo.
- ⚠️ `sample.xlsx` has been removed from this repo!
